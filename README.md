# Machine-Learning-of-Real-Time-Data-for-Asset-Management
 Algorithms and datasets for Machine Learning with applications to real-time asset management and optimization
 
Currently, the repository has a single dataset of 4 classes of 8x8 grey scale image. The data is ready to submit to TensorFlow (to simplify communications, we used alises to the 4 classes as Rock, Paper, Scissors and Wave), see for example https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images

The goals is to assess the performance of neural network and other machine learning algorithms within the TensorFlow framework in case of complex non-stationary data.
