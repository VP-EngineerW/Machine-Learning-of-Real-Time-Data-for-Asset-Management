The goal of the dataset is to assess the performance of neural network and other machine learning algorithms within the TensorFlow framework in case of complex non-stationary data
 
The dataset of 4 classes of 8x8 grey scale image. The data is ready to submit to TensorFlow (to simplify communications, we used alises to the 4 classes as Rock, Paper, Scissors and Wave), see for example https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images.
