# Dataset to assess the performance of algorithms within the TensorFlow framework

The goal of the dataset is to assess the performance of deep neural network and other machine learning algorithms within the TensorFlow framework in case of complex non-stationary data
 
The dataset has 4 classes of 8x8 grey scale images. The data is ready to submit to TensorFlow, see for example https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images. To simplify communications, we used alises for the 4 classes as Rock, Paper, Scissors and Wave.
